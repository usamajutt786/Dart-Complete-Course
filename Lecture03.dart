// Arithmetic Operators:
// This class of operators contain those operators which are used to perform arithmetic operation
// on the operands. They are binary operators i.e they act on two operands.
// the operators are..
// +, -(bitwise complement ) , * , / , % , ~/ , ~expr etc:

void main()
{
  int a=10;
  int b=3;
  var sum=a+b;
  print('The sum of a and b is $sum');
  var pro=a*b;
  print('The product of a and b is $pro');
  var div=a/b;
  print('The Division of a and b is $div');
  var mod=a%b;
  print('The modulus of a and b is $mod');
  var intdiv=a~/b;
  print('The integer dividion of a and b is $intdiv');
  var bit=~a;
  print('The bitwise comliment ais $bit');
