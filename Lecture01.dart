//DEfinition:
//Dart is the open-source programming language originally developed by Google. 
//It is meant for both server side as well as the user side.
// The Dart SDK comes with its compiler – the Dart VM and a utility dart2js which is
// meant for generating Javascript equivalent of a Dart 
//Script so that it can be run on those sites also which don’t support Dart. 
//Dart is Object-oriented language and is quite similar to that of Java Programming. 
//Dart is extensively use to create single-page websites and web-applications.
